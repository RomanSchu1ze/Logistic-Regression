@book{JeffGill,
	Abstract = {The emphasis in this edition of the Handbook of Research Design & Social Measurement, is on the tools graduate students and more advanced researchers need to conduct high quality research. This Handbook provides step-by-step instruction for students' research training beginning with how to find a creative idea, a middle-range theory, and initial hypothesis and proceeds through design, proposal, collection and analysis of data followed by writing, reporting and publication and presents extensive coverage of how to prepare manuscripts for publication, including a list of all journals covered by Sociological Abstracts along with the editorial office address and URL for each entry. It discusses the importance of policy research with presentation and discussion of specific models as an adjunct to both applied and basic research techniques and provides extensive coverage of funding opportunities including those offered by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and a directory of private funding sources including relevant contact information.},
